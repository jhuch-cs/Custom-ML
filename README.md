## Machine Learning Algorithms
* Single-Layer Perceptron
* Multi-Layer Perceptron
  * Implemented with error back-propagation
* Decision Tree, 
  * Implemented with information entropy as the `gain` condition
* K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
  * Both classification and regression implemented
* Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC)
* K-Means
